## High quality streaming of your usergroup on a shoestring

The past year we have been experimenting with streaming our events and create video's afterwards. In this article you can find our setup we found that works the best and with the least setup time.

To setup a live stream you need the record 3 input streams

* Screen from the presenter
* Audio from the presenter(s)
* Video of the stage



### Screen from the presenter
To capture the screen from the presenter you need to add a device that will capture the output from the laptop. The easiest way is to use a 'game capture device like the Elgate Capture HD60s.
The device has a HDMI input port and HDMI output port. The only thing you have to do is to put this device between the laptop and the projector. Connect the USB-3 to the computer that is going to publish the stream.

### Audio from the presenter(s)
When streaming a session the audio is an essential thing, you can ofcourse use the microphone from your laptop or the camera, but the change is very big that you audio is going to be very low in quality.

There are many different typos of mi
