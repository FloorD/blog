## High quality streaming of your usergroup on a shoestring

The past year we have been experimenting with streaming our events and create video's afterwards. In this article you can find our setup we found that works the best and with the least setup time.

To setup a live stream you need the record 3 input streams

* Screen from the presenter
* Audio from the presenter(s)
* Video of the stage



### Screen from the presenter
To capture the screen from the presenter you need to add a device that will capture the output from the laptop. The easiest way is to use a 'game capture device like the Elgate Capture HD60s.

#### Setup
The device has a HDMI input port and HDMI output port. The only thing you have to do is to put this device between the laptop and the projector. Connect the USB-3 to the computer that is going to publish the stream.

### Audio from the presenter(s)
When streaming a session the audio is an essential thing, you can ofcourse use the microphone from your laptop or the camera, but the chance is very big that your audio is going to be very low in quality. 

After a long search and trying out a few options we landend on the saramonic blink500 wireless microphones, see the list below why we choose them.
* Extreemly portable. (They are very small)
* Using 2.4GHz Channel. This frequency is allowed everywhere!
* You can use in the inbuild microphone in the sender (Just clip-on and go) or connect a lavelier microphone to the receiver for better quality.
* No mixer needed, just connect to a line-in (mini-jack)
* It comes with 2 senders and 1 receiver. This is perfect if you have 2 presenters.

#### Setup
Connect the line-out from the receiver to the line-in from the Elgato HD60s, connecting the mic to the HD60 will keep your line-in/out connection on your laptop free to output the captured audio.
